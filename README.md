# Final Project

Notes:

1) Seeking for the audio file does not work, because the audio files need to be stored in a server that allows streaming.

2) The command line tool I used for splicing is called "MP3WRAP".

3) The function for using MP3wrap is written in the Application controller.

4) To check that the audio splicing works, download the "podcast", and notice that it has 3 pop songs in it. I think "thrift shop" by Macklemore is the chosen "ad" for Chicago.

5) I changed the storage location for 'Carrierwave' to "/app/assets/podcast_audio"/.

6) I didn't add Users because: It is not part of the core experience or the purpose of the app; I would need to use a lot of if statements which will make the ugly (relatively) code look unnecessarily uglier.
  
  
  
  Thank you.
